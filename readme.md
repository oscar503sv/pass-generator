# Password generator

<br>

This program generates random passwords ranging from 8 to 16 characters. It allows you to choose whether the generated password should include uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols, and provides the flexibility to combine these options. The project has been developed using the Python programming language and its Tkinter library to create graphical interfaces."

**Usage:**
To use the program, it is recommended to clone the repository and then create a virtual environment using the command:

Linux/Mac OS
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
Windows
```
python -m venv venv
```
After creating the virtual environment, you need to install the dependencies for the program to function correctly. The dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them, use the following command:

Linux/Mac OS
```
pip3 install requirements.txt
```
Windows
```
pip install requirements.txt
```
After completing this step, you can execute the `main.py` file to launch the program. This is done using the command:

Linux/Mac OS
```
python3 main.py
```
Windows:
```
python main.py
```
